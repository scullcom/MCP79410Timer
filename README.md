# MCP79410_Timer

Timer library for the MCP79410 RTC Clock Chip, Initially for use with Scullcom Hobby Electronics DC Load.

Borrowed extensively from Ian Chilton: https://github.com/ichilton/mcp7941x_arduino.

This library provides functions required to implement a timer, not a full realtime clock.
